Express Apprentice 2
A developer who can implement build backend applications using NodeJS and Express.

Master the following skills:
Start a NodeJS application that uses Express: must install express (npm i express) then require it and call it like this:
const express = require("express") const app = require("express"())
Explain what ExpressJS is and what purpose it serves
  -Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.
  -Express is a minimal, open source and flexible Node.js web app framework designed to make developing websites, web apps, & API's much easier
  -Express provides the optimal building blocks like routing, middleware, and other components to get an application working quickly.
Build HTTP-based API endpoints with Express (see index.js for code.)
Apply best practices in folder/file structure in an Express application 
  -you add all folder structures in the src file folders like configs,controllers,middlewares,routes,services,models, and utils (reference go to https://blog.logrocket.com/organizing-express-js-project-structure-better-productivity/)

Validate incoming HTTP requests with middleware
(reference https://dev.to/singh1114/validate-your-request-parameters-using-validation-middleware-in-node-js-2gfo)
Route requests to different controller logic based on the shape of the request url:
Implement routes with parameters and use them to influence output:
app.get('/:id', function(req, res){
res.send('The id you specified is ' + req.params.id);
});
app.listen(3000);
Access querystring values and use them to influence output:

Separate logic code from routes using modules and imports:
(see wiki.js) this is when you take the handler (the function part of the route ) and separate it to another file then you require it in the router file and pass it in as a variable 
Render HTML from a template and json data 

Serve non-template static files with Express

Receive form data from HTTP request and use it to influence output

Debug Express application code with breakpoints

Allow CORS requests from all or specific origins

Utilize 3rd party plugins with an Express application
